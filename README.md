# Aprendamos a Volar Juntos 
### (Historic 2011-2013)

In the words of James E. Fauts

> Leaders receive and give assignments. This is an important part of the necessary principle of delegating. No one appreciates a willing volunteer more than I, but the total work cannot be done as the Lord wants it done merely by those doing the work who may be present at meetings.

**_Aprendamos a Volar Juntos_** was a social responsibility project carried out bye [AIESEC IPN - Mexico City](https://www.facebook.com/AIESEC.IPN.FANPAGE) on 2011 to 2013.
